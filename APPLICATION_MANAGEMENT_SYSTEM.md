# Application Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete Application Management System for the RecruTech recruiting platform that connects JobPostings â†” Applicants â†” Companies.

## Why This Feature?
- **Connects Existing Components**: Links JobPostings, Applicants, and Companies
- **Core Functionality**: Essential for a recruiting platform
- **Complete Workflow**: From application submission to hiring decision
- **Event-Driven**: Ready for notification service integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Layer (Platform Module)

#### Entities & Enums
- **ApplicationStatus Enum** (`application/model/ApplicationStatus.java`)
  - Status flow: SUBMITTED â†’ UNDER_REVIEW â†’ INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED â†’ INTERVIEWED â†’ OFFER_EXTENDED â†’ ACCEPTED/REJECTED/WITHDRAWN
  - Supports complete hiring workflow

- **Application Entity** (`application/model/Application.java`)
  - Relationships: applicantId (FK to applicants), jobPostingId (FK to job_postings)
  - Audit fields: createdByUserId, updatedByUserId, deletedByUserId
  - Content: coverLetter, resumeUrl, portfolioUrl
  - Lifecycle timestamps: submittedAt, reviewedAt, interviewScheduledAt, offerExtendedAt, finalizedAt
  - HR fields: hrNotes, rejectionReason
  - Soft delete support

#### Repository Layer
- **ApplicationRepository** (`application/repository/ApplicationRepository.java`)
  - Find by applicant (with optional status filter)
  - Find by job posting (with optional status filter)
  - Find by company (JOIN with job_postings, with optional status filter)
  - Duplicate application check
  - All queries support pagination and filter soft-deleted records

#### Database Migrations
- **Liquibase Migration** (`db.changelog/v0.1/06-create-applications-table.xml`)
  - Complete table structure with all fields
  - Foreign key constraints with proper CASCADE/SET NULL behaviors
  - Performance indexes: applicantId, jobPostingId, status combinations
  - Unique index for duplicate prevention
  - Updated master changelog to include new migration

### 2. Service Layer (Platform Module)

#### ApplicationService (`application/service/ApplicationService.java`)
- **Submission**: 
  - Duplicate application prevention
  - Automatic timestamp setting
  - Validation of all IDs

- **Status Management**:
  - Validates status transitions (enforces allowed workflow paths)
  - Prevents modification of finalized applications (ACCEPTED/REJECTED/WITHDRAWN)
  - Updates lifecycle timestamps automatically
  - Supports HR notes and rejection reasons

- **Query Methods**:
  - By applicant (with pagination & status filter)
  - By job posting (with pagination & status filter)
  - By company (with pagination & status filter)

- **Withdrawal**:
  - Applicant can withdraw own applications
  - Ownership verification
  - Cannot withdraw finalized applications

- **Business Rules**:
  - Status transition validation with clear error messages
  - Duplicate application prevention
  - Finalized state protection
  - Comprehensive audit trail

### 3. Event Infrastructure (Common Module)

#### Event Classes
- **BaseEvent** (`common/event/BaseEvent.java`)
  - Base class for all domain events
  - Contains: eventId, occurredAt, eventType
  - Immutable design for event integrity

- **ApplicationSubmittedEvent** (`common/event/ApplicationSubmittedEvent.java`)
  - Published when new application is submitted
  - Contains: applicationId, applicantId, jobPostingId, companyId
  - Ready for notification service integration

- **ApplicationStatusChangedEvent** (`common/event/ApplicationStatusChangedEvent.java`)
  - Published when application status changes
  - Contains: applicationId, applicantId, jobPostingId, companyId, previousStatus, newStatus, updatedByUserId
  - Enables notifications for status updates

### 4. REST API Layer (Platform Module)

#### DTOs (`application/dto/`)
- **ApplicationSubmitRequest**: For submitting new applications
  - Validation: applicantId and jobPostingId required
  - Optional: coverLetter, resumeUrl, portfolioUrl

- **ApplicationResponse**: Complete application data
  - All entity fields including status, timestamps, audit info

- **ApplicationUpdateStatusRequest**: For HR status updates
  - Validation: status required
  - Optional: hrNotes, rejectionReason

#### Mapper
- **ApplicationMapper** (`application/mapper/ApplicationMapper.java`)
  - Static utility class for entity â†” DTO conversion
  - toResponse() method for clean API responses

#### Controller
- **ApplicationController** (`application/controller/ApplicationController.java`)
  - **POST /applications** - Submit new application
  - **GET /applications/{id}** - Get application by ID
  - **GET /applications/applicant/{applicantId}** - List applicant's applications
  - **GET /applications/job-posting/{jobPostingId}** - List applications for job posting
  - **GET /applications/company/{companyId}** - List applications for company's jobs
  - **PUT /applications/{id}/status** - Update application status (HR)
  - **POST /applications/{id}/withdraw** - Withdraw application (applicant)
  - **DELETE /applications/{id}** - Soft delete application
  - All list endpoints support pagination (page, size, sort) and optional status filtering

## Best Practices Applied

### Clean Code
âœ“ Clear separation of concerns (controller â†’ service â†’ repository â†’ entity)
âœ“ Single Responsibility Principle (each class has one purpose)
âœ“ Comprehensive Javadoc documentation
âœ“ Meaningful naming conventions
âœ“ Immutable DTOs using Java records
âœ“ Constants for error messages and magic numbers

### Architecture
âœ“ Layered architecture (controller â†’ service â†’ repository â†’ entity)
âœ“ Repository pattern for data access
âœ“ DTO pattern for API layer
âœ“ Mapper pattern for entity/DTO conversion
âœ“ Event-driven design ready for notifications
âœ“ Pagination support for scalability

### Data Integrity
âœ“ Foreign key constraints in database
âœ“ Soft delete pattern (preserves history)
âœ“ Duplicate prevention (can't apply twice to same job)
âœ“ Status transition validation (enforces workflow)
âœ“ Comprehensive audit trail (who, when, what)
âœ“ Lifecycle timestamps for tracking

### Validation & Error Handling
âœ“ Jakarta validation annotations on DTOs
âœ“ UUID validation for all IDs
âœ“ Business rule validation in service layer
âœ“ Custom exceptions (NotFoundException, ValidationException)
âœ“ Clear, user-friendly error messages

### Performance
âœ“ Database indexes on frequently queried fields
âœ“ Pagination support on all list endpoints
âœ“ Optimized queries (JOIN for company lookups)
âœ“ Soft delete filtering in queries

(WITHDRAWN can happen at any non-final state)
```

## Database Schema

### applications Table
- **Primary Key**: id (CHAR(36) - UUID)
- **Foreign Keys**: 
  - applicant_id â†’ applicants.id (CASCADE)
  - job_posting_id â†’ job_postings.id (CASCADE)
  - created_by_user_id â†’ users.id (RESTRICT)
  - updated_by_user_id â†’ users.id (SET NULL)
  - deleted_by_user_id â†’ users.id (SET NULL)
- **Indexes**: 
  - applicant_id
  - job_posting_id
  - applicant_id + status
  - job_posting_id + status
  - applicant_id + job_posting_id + is_deleted (for duplicate check)
  - is_deleted

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
âœ“ **Applicants** (auth module): Links to applicant profiles
âœ“ **JobPostings** (platform module): Links to job postings
âœ“ **Companies** (auth module): Accessible via JobPosting.companyId
âœ“ **Users** (auth module): Audit trail via userId fields

### Future Integrations
